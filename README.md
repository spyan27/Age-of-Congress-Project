# Age-of-Congress-Project

The aim of this project was to analyze the age trends in Congress using the congress-demographics data from FiveThirtyEight. Inspired by [Skelley's 2023 article](https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/aging-congress-boomers/), I used time-series, both linear & polynomial regression, and web-scrapping as the primary methods to gain further insight into the future of Congress' age demographics.

Thank so much and enjoy!!
