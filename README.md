# Age-of-Congress-Project

Here's a revised version of your README that provides more detail and a clearer structure:

## Age Trends in Congress
This project analyzes age trends in Congress using the Congress-Demographics data from FiveThirtyEighty. Inspired by Skelley's 2023 article, I applied various methods to gain insights into the future age demographics of Congress.

## Project Overview
The main goals of this project are to:

Examine historical age trends in Congress for greater insight into the future.
Analyze whether age trends differ between demographics. 
Understand the relationship between age trends and congressional productivity. 

## Methods 
Utilized **web-scrapping** for getting additional data on congressional productivity (i.e., number of bills passed)
Conducted **time-series analysis** to observe historical trends 
Applied **multiple linear & polynomial regression models** to predict future ages trends

## Results
The detailed results, including specific analyses, reports, and conclusions, are available in the written report.

## Acknowledgments
Thanks to FiveThirtyEight for providing the data.
